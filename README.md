# About
This is a React project generated using Create React App to automatically set up my webpack and typescript config, including scss loaders.
I'm using the newer syntax for sass files, i.e. .scss extensions.

# Running
To run, execute `npm start` from the terminal. 

`npm start` will install npm packages, build the project, and run it on localhost:3000

You'll need node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6.

`node -v`
`npm -v`
